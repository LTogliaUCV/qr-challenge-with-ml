## QR Code Scanner with Machine Learning
This is a demo program that shows how to use machine learning techniques to read QR codes in images. The program uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the content of QR codes and associate them with a descriptive label.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need the following Python libraries:

qrcode
numpy
opencv-python
zxing
keras
tensorflow
These libraries can be installed using the pip package manager:


## How it works
This program generates 1000 random QR codes and saves them in a directory called "qr_codes". It then loads the images of the QR codes and their corresponding labels. The program uses this information to train a CNN model using TensorFlow.

After training the model, the program loads an image containing a QR code using the OpenCV library. It then uses the QR code detector object from the zxing library to find the QR codes in the image. If a QR code is found in the image, the program uses the trained CNN model to classify the content of the QR code and associate it with a descriptive label.

## How to use
To use this program, make sure you have an image containing a QR code to analyze. Place the image in the same directory as the Python file and make sure it is called "qr1.png".

Then simply run the Python file and wait for the execution to complete. The program will display the content of the QR code in the image, if one is found.

It is important to note that, due to the random nature of the generated QR codes, the model may misclassify some of the QR codes in the image. However, this program shows how to use machine learning techniques to analyze images and can be used as a basis for more advanced QR code detection projects.
